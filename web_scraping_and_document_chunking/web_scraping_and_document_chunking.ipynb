In the final against Slovenia, she scored 29 points all by herself, but unfortunately, it wasn't quite enough to win the gold medal for her team.[8]\n",

      "The next year brought an incredible achievement as Bošković played a pivotal role in Serbia's U19 national team securing victory in the 2014 Women's Junior European Volleyball Championship by defeating Slovenia in an exciting five-setter match.[9] Bošković earned her the well-deserved title of Most Valuable Player, as she topped the scorers with 38 points in the final match.

      "A year later, Bošković stepped onto the world stage, making her debut with the Serbia national team at the prestigious 2014 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship. Despite being the youngest player on the team, Bošković left an instant impression by emerging as the top scorer for Serbia in many matches. She showcased her talent by scoring a total of 129 points in eight games, contributing significantly to the team's seventh-place finish.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "The iconic American player turned coach, Karch Kiraly, was thoroughly impressed by Bošković's performance, expressing that she is \"set for big things.\" Kiraly's words of praise acknowledged Bošković's exceptional talent and hinted at a promising future for her in the world of volleyball.\n",

      "“I’m still trying to understand how she’s still only 17 years-old. She’s far beyond her years and if she’s only 17 she’s got an incredibly bright future.

      "Despite being one of the least experienced players, Bošković participated in the tournament after her triumph at the 2014 Women's Junior European Volleyball Championship. Serbia's head coach, Zoran Terzic, revealed that Bošković had only trained with the senior national team for a mere three or four days before the World Championship. He explained that his plan was to include her in this tournament as preparation for the upcoming 2015 European Championship and the 2016 Olympic Games.[15]\n",

      "Hailing from Bileca, Bošković, the standout volleyball player born in this small town, received an extraordinary honor in 2018. The Minister of Foreign Affairs for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Igor Crnadak, presented her with a diplomatic passport at the General Consulate in Istanbul.

      "\n",
      "In July 2019, the sports hall in Bileća was officially named after Tijana Bošković – who took her first sporting steps in this hall, in a special ceremony led by the President of the National Assembly, Nedeljko Čubrilović and Bošković herself. During a press conference, Čubrilović expressed that Bošković's achievements serve as a great inspiration for young people in the Republic of Srpska and worldwide. He emphasized that the Republic of Srpska is committed to supporting young athletes and acknowledged that Bošković deserves even more recognition.[72]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bošković, deeply honored by the decision, thanked the municipality of Bileća and everyone involved in this initiative. She pledged to continue representing her city and herself with excellence, striving for more successes and medals in the future. President of the Serbian Volleyball Federation, Zoran Gajić, highlighted that the facility aptly bears Bošković's name, recognizing her unwavering character from her early days in the Bileća sports hall to her current status as the best volleyball player in the world. MP Radovan Vuković proposed the idea of organizing a volleyball school or camp in Bileća, also carrying the name of Tijana Bošković, as a testament to her lasting impact on the community.\n",

She has won gold medals with the Serbia women\\'s national volleyball team at the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, and the 2017 and 2019 European Championships. She is also a two-time Olympic medalist, having won silver at the 2016 Rio Games and bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Games. Bošković is left-handed and has been one of Serbia’s key players ever since her debut with the national team in 2014. By the age of 21, she had already played in gold medal matches in all major tournaments (Olympic Games, World Championship, and European Championship), and she was one of the players who contributed a lot of winning points for Serbia. Bošković\\'s record in major championships is nothing short of phenomenal – 10 majors played, reaching the semifinals 9 times and making it to the finals 7 times. So far, she has never missed standing on the podium in every major she has played, except for her debut year at the 2014 World Championship. Being selected for the 2019 European Volleyball Confederation Female Volleyball Player of the Year award, Bošković has recorded an impressive achievement by receiving that award for three consecutive years (2017, 2018, 2019).[2][3][4] Bošković became the first woman to spike and serve at a speed exceeding 110 km/h.[5] Eczacıbaşı Dynavit– Imoco Volley Conegliano match at the 2022 FIVB Club World Championship, Bošković broke the women\\'s world record for the fastest serve at a lightning speed of 111.4 km/h. [6] spike speed by hitting the ball at an incredible 110.9 km/h in the same game. This puts her as the second-fastest spiker in women\\'s volleyball history, sharing the spot with Annie Drews, just behind Paola Egonu. Career – National team[edit] Junior team[edit] Bošković began her national volleyball team career when she was just 15 years old, joining the Serbian junior team.[7] In 2013, she won a silver medal at the 2013 European Youth Olympic Festival, where she was named the Most Valuable Player and Best Spiker. In the final against Slovenia, she scored 29 points all by herself, but unfortunately, it wasn\\'t quite enough to win the gold medal for her team.[8] The next year brought an incredible achievement as Bošković played a pivotal role in Serbia\\'s U19 national team securing victory in the 2014 Women\\'s Junior European Volleyball Championship by defeating Slovenia in an exciting five-setter match.[9] Bošković earned her the well-deserved title of Most Valuable Player, as she topped the scorers with 38 points in the final match. This victory was a historic moment for Serbian volleyball, as it marked their first gold medal in a junior-level competition.[10] Senior team[edit] 2013–2014: Debut with Serbia women\\'s national team[edit] At just 16 years old, Bošković received a special call-up to join the senior national team in December 2013 for a two-week training session.[11] A year later, Bošković stepped onto the world stage, making her debut with the Serbia national team at the prestigious 2014 FIVB Volleyball Women\\'s World Championship. Despite being the youngest player on the team, Bošković left an instant impression by emerging as the top scorer for Serbia in many matches. She showcased her talent by scoring a total of 129 points in eight games, contributing significantly to the team\\'s seventh-place finish.[12] The iconic American player turned coach, Karch Kiraly, was thoroughly impressed by Bošković\\'s performance, expressing that she is \"set for big things.\" Kiraly\\'s words of praise acknowledged Bošković\\'s exceptional talent and hinted at a promising future for her in the world of volleyball. “I’m still trying to understand how she’s still only 17 years-old. She’s far beyond her years and if she’s only 17 she’s got an incredibly bright future. She’s going to be a big and important player for Serbia for many years to come. She understands the game well, she can take these high swings and she’s a handful.”[13] Bošković, who joined the team shortly before the start of the tournament, was pleasantly surprised to receive the national team call-up and felt grateful for the opportunity. “I didn\\'t imagine that I would play at the World Championship. I\\'m very happy just for the fact that I\\'m here. It\\'s for sure a wonderful experience for me and for my future.”[14] Despite being one of the least experienced players, Bošković participated in the tournament after her triumph at the 2014 Women\\'s Junior European Volleyball Championship. Serbia\\'s head coach, Zoran Terzic, revealed that Bošković had only trained with the senior national team for a mere three or four days before the World Championship. He explained that his plan was to include her in this tournament as preparation for the upcoming 2015 European Championship and the 2016 Olympic Games.[15] 2015–2016: First medal with national team, European Championship bronze medalist and Olympic Rio silver medalist[edit] Bošković achieved her first medal with the senior national team by clinching the silver at the 2015 FIVB Volleyball Women\\'s World Cup. This competition served as a qualification event for the Olympic Games, and Serbia\\'s second-place finish secured their spot at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Bošković, emerging as Serbia\\'s leading scorer, tallied a total of 159 points. Notably, she ranked among the top three highest scorers in the tournament and was the youngest player to be featured in the top 10 scorers\\' list.[16] Bošković made her first appearance in the Women\\'s European Volleyball Championship and secured her first medal in a major tournament. The team\\'s victory over Turkey in straight sets earned them the bronze medal at the 2015 Women\\'s European Volleyball Championship.[17] 2016 Summer Olympics. This achievement marked Serbia\\'s first-ever medal in Olympic Games volleyball history.

This year marked her return to the VNL after skipping the last two editions, with her previous appearance in week 1 of the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women\\'s Nations League held in Belgrade, Serbia.

After playing for only one season with the club, she transferred to ŽOK Partizan Vizura, a club from Serbia, at the beginning of the 2011–12 season. She left her family when she was only 14 years old and moved to Belgrade with her older sister.[41] Bošković started playing in the Serbian League as an Outside hitter for the team. She was awarded as the Best Outside Hitter at the 2012–13 Serbian Cup. Subsequently, her role on the court evolved to that of an Opposite Spiker starting from the 2013–14 season, a transition that marked a significant chapter in her career.

[42] Eczacıbaşı, one of the volleyball giants, signing a substantial four-year contract with the club. In 2016, UTSA volleyball head coach Laura Neugebauer-Groff tried to recruit Bošković to play in America for a year, along with her sister Dajana.

In the 2016–17 CEV Champions League, Bošković and her team advanced to the Final Four held in Italy. The team defeated Dynamo Moscow in four sets to win the bronze medal.

Her amazing performance included scoring a total of 515 points,[53] placing her position as one of the top two scorers in the competition.

Early and personal life[edit] Serb parents on 8 March 1997 in Trebinje, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bošković can speak three languages: Serbian, Turkish and English. [62] [63] Bosnia and Herzegovina women\\'s national volleyball team. The two sisters played their first international match against each other in 2021 Women\\'s European Volleyball Championship. [64] Based on Bošković\\'s social media updates, she is currently dating Djorde Orestijevic, a software engineer residing in Serbia.[65] They both keep their personal life private, so the exact start and details of their relationship are not widely known. Bošković hails from Bosnia and Herzegovina but holds Serbian citizenship. Born in Trebinje, a city located in Republika Srpska, she has been playing for Serbia since the age of 15. Unlike naturalized players who often face a two-year waiting period after acquiring citizenship, Bošković, having Serbian citizenship already, did not undergo such a waiting period, following the rules of the International Volleyball Federation. Bošković initially ventured into sports through karate[66] but found it less suitable due to her tall stature. Her journey into volleyball began when she attended one of her older sister\\'s volleyball matches. Inspired by the game, she made the decision to become a volleyball player herself. Bošković transitioned to volleyball at the age of 7,[67] during her primary school years. She quickly excelled, winning three championships with her school team.[68] Before joining the Serbia junior team, Bošković attracted the attention of Galatasaray while playing in a match in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The club invited her and her sister, Dajana, to Istanbul, Turkey, for trial training. Accepting the offer, Bošković, along with her sister, traveled to Istanbul with their father. After showcasing her talent in training, Bošković, who was just 12 at the time, received praise from the coaches. Galatasaray\\'s managers then approached her family with a transfer offer, including the option to acquire Turkish citizenship and play for the Turkish national team. However, her father firmly declined the offer, emphasizing that Bošković would only represent the Serbia national team. Consequently, they returned to Serbia, where she continued her promising volleyball journey.[69] Recognition and rewards[edit] Having achieved numerous achievements and individual awards at such a young age, Tijana Bošković, the world-class volleyball player, has received widespread acknowledgment and rewards. This recognition extends beyond governmental appreciation to include non-governmental organizations, underscoring her exceptional contributions to the sport of volleyball. Serbian Volleyball Champions Honored with Generous Donations and Advocates for Sports Recognition[edit] President Milorad Dodik of Republika Srpska announced a generous donation of KM 20,000 (US$11,000) each to the acclaimed volleyball players Tijana Bošković, Brankica Mihajlović, and Jelena Blagojević. This gesture, accompanied by appropriate gifts, comes in celebration of their remarkable achievement in securing the gold medal for the Serbian national team at the 2017 European Volleyball Championship. Following discussions with Bošković and Mihajlović, both gold medalists at the European Championship, Dodik conveyed his pride in having female volleyball players from Republika Srpska contribute to the success of the Serbian national team, emphasizing the potential this showcases for the region. Bošković extended her thanks to President Dodik and the welcoming reception they received, expressing hope for continued success and appreciation for the ongoing support.[70] Diplomatic Passport of Bosnia and Herzegovina to The Best Volleyball Player in Europe[edit] Hailing from Bileca, Bošković, the standout volleyball player born in this small town, received an extraordinary honor in 2018. The Minister of Foreign Affairs for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Igor Crnadak, presented her with a diplomatic passport at the General Consulate in Istanbul. This recognition wasn\\'t just for her sports achievements but was part of a broader humanitarian-sports campaign.[71] Sports Hall in Bileća Named After World\\'s Best Volleyball Player[edit] In July 2019, the sports hall in Bileća was officially named after Tijana Bošković – who took her first sporting steps in this hall, in a special ceremony led by the President of the National Assembly, Nedeljko Čubrilović and Bošković herself. During a press conference, Čubrilović expressed that Bošković\\'s achievements serve as a great inspiration for young people in the Republic of Srpska and worldwide. He emphasized that the Republic of Srpska is committed to supporting young athletes and acknowledged that Bošković deserves even more recognition.[72] Bošković, deeply honored by the decision, thanked the municipality of Bileća and everyone involved in this initiative. She pledged to continue representing her city and herself with excellence, striving for more successes and medals in the future. President of the Serbian Volleyball Federation, Zoran Gajić, highlighted that the facility aptly bears Bošković\\'s name, recognizing her unwavering character from her early days in the Bileća sports hall to her current status as the best volleyball player in the world. MP Radovan Vuković proposed the idea of organizing a volleyball school or camp in Bileća, also carrying the name of Tijana Bošković, as a testament to her lasting impact on the community. Diplomatic Honors for Serbian Volleyball Stars[edit] Ivica Dačić personally presented diplomatic passports of Serbia to the members of the Serbian national volleyball teams. Among the honored athletes were Maja Ognjenović, Tijana Bošković, Ana Bjelica, Jovana Stevanović, and Teodora Pušić. During discussions with the athletes, Minister Dačić expressed that this act serves as a token of gratitude from the state to individuals who have consistently brought medals to Serbia.
