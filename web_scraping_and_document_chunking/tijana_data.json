As of May 22, 2018, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 had a contract for one more season with Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131. However, she made the decision to extend her commitment until the conclusion of the 2020\u20132021 season.[54] Notably, despite receiving tempting offers from clubs in China, Japan, Brazil, and other Turkish clubs, she opted to stay loyal to her current team for an additional three seasons. 2019\u20132020 Season[edit] In the subsequent year, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 added another trophy to her collection by winning her second Turkish Super Cup with the team. She was awarded the title of Most Valuable Player of the tournament. Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 won the silver medal at the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 was the best server in the tournament, recording an impressive 0.74 average per set with a total of 14 aces. The team was unable to finish another three tournaments for 2019\u201320 season due to Covid-19 outbreak. 2020\u20132021 Season[edit] Following the departure of team captain Kim Yeon-Koung in the 2020\u201321 season, the leadership of the team transitioned to two temporary captains, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 and Simge Ak\u00f6z. In this season, she secured her third Turkish Super Cup and was honored as the Most Valuable Player for the second consecutive time. Despite her team finishing in the 4th position in the 2020\u201321 Turkish Volleyball League, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 showcased incredible performance, claimed the top spot on the best scorer chart by scoring a total of 692 points with an impressive average of 6.65 points per set, particularly with a remarkable 52% success rate in spike attempts.

She was appointed as the captain of the team. 2021\u20132022 Season[edit] Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 kicked off the season by clinching the silver medal in the Turkish Super Cup. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 guided Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 to clinch yet another CEV Cup trophy at the 2021\u201322 Women's CEV Cup, where she not only excelled as the best scorer of the tournament but also displayed her prowess as the best spiker. Accumulating a total of 170 points with an impressive 56.5% success rate, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 showcased her dominance on the court. Additionally, she was one of the top two best servers and top three best blockers in the tournament, further highlighting her multifaceted contributions to the team's success.[55] Finishing third in the regular league, the 2021\u201322 Turkish Volleyball League, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 showcased her scoring prowess by accumulating a total of 483 points. Notably, she secured the position as the second-highest scorer in the league, coupled with an impressive success rate of 52%.[56] 2022\u20132023 Season[edit] The team won the bronze medal at the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship, with Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 not only earning the title of best server of the tournament but also standing out as the best scorer, best attacker, and best blocker for her team.[57] Boskovic and her team experienced another disappointment in the Turkish League final, suffering a loss to Fenerbah\u00e7e. Apart from that, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 stood out as the top scorer per set throughout the tournament, boasting an impressive 6.09 average and a 54% success rate in attacks.[58] Boskovic achieved a historic milestone in her career, reaching the CEV Champions League final for the first time. However, the team faced a tough defeat against their Turkish rival, Vak\u0131fBank, in four sets. Throughout the tournament, Boskovic showcased her excellence, emerging as the top scorer for her team.[59] Concluding her eighth season with Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 made the decision to continue her journey with the club for at least another year until 2023\u201324, with the added provision of a renewal option for the subsequent season, 2024\u201325. In a significant development, she extended her contract with an annual salary exceeding \u20ac1.45 million (US$1.59 million) per season, solidifying her position as one of the highest-paid volleyball players globally.[60] 2023\u20132024 Season[edit] Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 and Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 commenced the season triumphantly, clinching a long-awaited trophy at the 2023 FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship. In a thrilling five-set final, they secured victory over Turkish rival Vak\u0131fBank. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107's outstanding performance earned her the coveted titles of Most Valuable Player and Best Opposite of the tournament. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 further distinguished herself by being the top two in best scorer, best attacker, and best server categories. She also claimed the third spot in best digger, showcasing her exceptional all-around skills, closely trailing behind two liberos.[61] Overall, She has won eight trophies with Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 in total. She has won three Turkish SuperCup (2018, 2019 and 2020), two CEV Cup (2017\u201318 and 2021\u201322), two FIVB Club World Championship (2016 and 2023) and one Turkish Cup (2018\u201319). Early and personal life[edit] Serb parents on 8 March 1997 in Trebinje, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 can speak three languages: Serbian, Turkish and English. [62] [63] Bosnia and Herzegovina women's national volleyball team. The two sisters played their first international match against each other in 2021 Women's European Volleyball Championship. [64] Based on Bo\u0161kovi\u0107's social media updates, she is currently dating Djorde Orestijevic, a software engineer residing in Serbia.[65] They both keep their personal life private, so the exact start and details of their relationship are not widely known. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 hails from Bosnia and Herzegovina but holds Serbian citizenship. Born in Trebinje, a city located in Republika Srpska, she has been playing for Serbia since the age of 15. Unlike naturalized players who often face a two-year waiting period after acquiring citizenship, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, having Serbian citizenship already, did not undergo such a waiting period, following the rules of the International Volleyball Federation. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 initially ventured into sports through karate[66] but found it less suitable due to her tall stature. Her journey into volleyball began when she attended one of her older sister's volleyball matches. Inspired by the game, she made the decision to become a volleyball player herself. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 transitioned to volleyball at the age of 7,[67] during her primary school years. She quickly excelled, winning three championships with her school team.[68] Before joining the Serbia junior team, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 attracted the attention of Galatasaray while playing in a match in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The club invited her and her sister, Dajana, to Istanbul, Turkey, for trial training. Accepting the offer, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, along with her sister, traveled to Istanbul with their father. After showcasing her talent in training, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, who was just 12 at the time, received praise from the coaches. Galatasaray's managers then approached her family with a transfer offer, including the option to acquire Turkish citizenship and play for the Turkish national team. However, her father firmly declined the offer, emphasizing that Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 would only represent the Serbia national team. Consequently, they returned to Serbia, where she continued her promising volleyball journey.[69] Recognition and rewards[edit] Having achieved numerous achievements and individual awards at such a young age, Tijana Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, the world-class volleyball player, has received widespread acknowledgment and rewards. This recognition extends beyond governmental appreciation to include non-governmental organizations, underscoring her exceptional contributions to the sport of volleyball. Serbian Volleyball Champions Honored with Generous Donations and Advocates for Sports Recognition[edit] President Milorad Dodik of Republika Srpska announced a generous donation of KM 20,000 (US$11,000) each to the acclaimed volleyball players Tijana Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, Brankica Mihajlovi\u0107, and Jelena Blagojevi\u0107. This gesture, accompanied by appropriate gifts, comes in celebration of their remarkable achievement in securing the gold medal for the Serbian national team at the 2017 European Volleyball Championship. Following discussions with Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107, both gold medalists at the European Championship, Dodik conveyed his pride in having female volleyball players from Republika Srpska contribute to the success of the Serbian national team, emphasizing the potential this showcases for the region. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 extended her thanks to President Dodik and the welcoming reception they received, expressing hope for continued success and appreciation for the ongoing support.[70] Diplomatic Passport of Bosnia and Herzegovina to The Best Volleyball Player in Europe[edit] Hailing from Bileca, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, the standout volleyball player born in this small town, received an extraordinary honor in 2018. The Minister of Foreign Affairs for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Igor Crnadak, presented her with a diplomatic passport at the General Consulate in Istanbul. This recognition wasn't just for her sports achievements but was part of a broader humanitarian-sports campaign.[71] Sports Hall in Bile\u0107a Named After World's Best Volleyball Player[edit] In July 2019, the sports hall in Bile\u0107a was officially named after Tijana Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 \u2013 who took her first sporting steps in this hall, in a special ceremony led by the President of the National Assembly, Nedeljko \u010cubrilovi\u0107 and Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 herself. During a press conference, \u010cubrilovi\u0107 expressed that Bo\u0161kovi\u0107's achievements serve as a great inspiration for young people in the Republic of Srpska and worldwide. He emphasized that the Republic of Srpska is committed to supporting young athletes and acknowledged that Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 deserves even more recognition.[72] Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, deeply honored by the decision, thanked the municipality of Bile\u0107a and everyone involved in this initiative. She pledged to continue representing her city and herself with excellence, striving for more successes and medals in the future. President of the Serbian Volleyball Federation, Zoran Gaji\u0107, highlighted that the facility aptly bears Bo\u0161kovi\u0107's name, recognizing her unwavering character from her early days in the Bile\u0107a sports hall to her current status as the best volleyball player in the world. MP Radovan Vukovi\u0107 proposed the idea of organizing a volleyball school or camp in Bile\u0107a, also carrying the name of Tijana Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, as a testament to her lasting impact on the community. Diplomatic Honors for Serbian Volleyball Stars[edit] Ivica Da\u010di\u0107 personally presented diplomatic passports of Serbia to the members of the Serbian national volleyball teams. Among the honored athletes were Maja Ognjenovi\u0107, Tijana Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, Ana Bjelica, Jovana Stevanovi\u0107, and Teodora Pu\u0161i\u0107. During discussions with the athletes, Minister Da\u010di\u0107 expressed that this act serves as a token of gratitude from the state to individuals who have consistently brought medals to Serbia. Da\u010di\u0107 further underlined that while diplomatic passports are not prerequisites for these accomplished athletes to serve as ambassadors for their country, their achievements and conduct have already established them as exemplary representatives.
